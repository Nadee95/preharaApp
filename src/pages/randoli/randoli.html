		The month of July which is also called “ Esala ”, is 	considered as a month of celebrations and festivity among most of Sri Lankans. It is also considered as the beginning of the rainy season for Sri Lankan up country. Since the 6th BC, Esala festival had been held to celebrate Buddha's special life events namely, the conception, renunciation and the first sermon. Dalada perahara is the biggest event in the celebration of Esala. Most of the ancient and specific features of Dalada perahara can be seen today, with the addition of some features with the available resources. In the 18th century, when king Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe was ruling the country, Dalada pemahare was combined with four other devala peraharas to create a series of perehare. This glorious event was celebrated since the antient times !!
