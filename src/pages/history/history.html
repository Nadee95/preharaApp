    <h2> History of Esala Perahera</h2>
    <p>The Esala is believed to be a fusion of two separate but interconnected "Peraheras" (Processions) – The Esala and Dalada.
      The Esala Perahera, which is thought to date back to the 3rd century BC, was a ritual enacted to request the gods for
      rainfall. The Dalada Perahera is believed to have begun when the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha was brought to Sri
      Lanka from India during the 4th century CE, eight hundred years after the passing away of Lord Buddha.</p>
    <p> According to tradition, the Tooth Relic was taken in procession to Sri Lanka by Princess Hemamala & Prince Dantha. </p>
    <p> A link with the past, the Kandy Perahera reflects the glory of the days that are no more, the days of the pomp and splendour
      of the Kandyan monarchy when the King personally directed the arrangements for the great event. It then served the
      further purpose of a royal levee, at which were present the two Adigars, (Governors of Provinces) and all the other
      chiefs. The King took his stand at the Octagon of the Dalada Maligawa—termed the Pattiruppuwa, and presented himself
      to the view of his assembled subjects in the square below, who eagerly awaited a sight of his Royal Majesty.</p>
    <p> The Adigars satisfied the King as to the disposition of the several components of the long procession each in its due
      order of precedence. The procession being duly formed and marshalled in the temple square, the King with all ceremony
      brought the Karanduwa, or the relic casket containing the Tooth Relic which he placed within the ransivige on the howdah
      upon the Maligawa tusker.</p>
    <p> The story of the Kandy Esala Perahera runs con-current with the history of the Kandyan monarchy. All Peraheras of Ceylon
      are annual celebrations of a devalaya dedicated to one of the Gods. An additional sacredness of the Kandy Perahera
      is its association with the Danta Dhatu, the Tooth Relic. As the safety of the kingdom depended on the Tooth Relic,
      the Perahera at the capital where the Tooth was enshrined, received royal patronage.</p>
    <p> The Kandyan King was the source of all pageantry and pomp. Two of the main devales of Kandy, the Maha Vishnu Devale and
      Naha Devale are regarded as built by King Narendra Sinha (1707-1739). The subsequent Kings, Sri Vijaya Raja Sinha (173-9-1747),
      Kirti Sri Raja Sinha (1747-1780), Sri Rajadhi Raja Sinha (1780—1798) and Sri Wickrama Raja Sinha (1798—1815) maintained
      the tradition.</p>
    <p> All the Peraheras of the Island follow the pattern of the Kandy Perahera, and all Peraheras were continued to be held
      by the Kandyan Kings. At Kandy the responsibility of conducting the Perahera was vested in the First and Second Adigars
      during the days of the Kandyan Monarchy. Subsequently this became the responsibility of the Diyawadana Nilame of the
      Dalada</p>
    <p> Maligawa, who dons the gorgeous dress of a Kandyan Chief with the distinctive head dress. The chief official of a devale
      is termed the Basnayake Nilame and such dignitaries at most of the devales of Ceylon are Kandyans. An interesting exception
      is the Basnayake Nilame of the Dondra (Devundura) devale, who though a Low-country Sinhalese, wears the costume of
      a Kandyan Chief.</p>
    <p> All the Peraheras follow the pattern of procession of the Chief officers, the elephants, drummers and dancers. Among
      the time-honoured peraheras are those of Kandy, Gampola, Ratnapura, Dondra, Kotte, Alutnuwara, and Kataragama. For
      pageantry and magnificence of display, the annual perahera of the Kotte Raja Maha Vihare, comes close to the Kandy
      Perahera. No perahera approaches the Kandy Perahera in the wealth of its picturesque variety, its inordinate length,
      and its exuberance of dancers and folk-plays. Kotte having been an earlier Capital of the Kings, the perahera there
      is indeed brilliant, next only to Kandy. The tradition at Kotte is one established by King Sri Parakramabahu VI, who
      ascended the throne in 1415 A.D. Successive Kings respected and maintained the tradition, even in the Kandyan period.</p>
    <p> Queyroz, the eminent Portuguese historian has left an account of the Kotte Kings in his book "The Temporal and Spiritual
      Conquest of Ceylon" in these words:</p>
    <p> "This the ancient King of Kotte signified by certain celebrated processions called peraheras, which lasted 16 days some
      being held by day and others at night, which amounted to thirty two, and these by night were more famous. In them women
      took part with the same licence as in the Feast of Bacchus. The King used to go in them with a bangle on one foot,
      made up of fifteen beads, which represents those over whom he dominated." </p>
    <p> De Queyroz has over-drawn the picture of the place of the women dancers—who in the early and late Middle Ages were a
      feature at all temple processions in South India and Ceylon, and temples maintained families of dancers and musicians,
      who were remunerated by lands held on service tenure.</p>
